## Procedurally Generated Environment in OpenGL

Using a variety of noise generation algorithms working together, the program creates a terrain filled with mountains, hills, and plains.

In its current form, the repository consists of CodeBlocks project structure along with the source. As a result, the code is setup to work on Windows, and an executable is included in the bin folder.

## Features

 - Seemingly endless terrain that expands as you move
 - FPS Camera
 - Movement with WASD
 - Gravity to allow for jumping
